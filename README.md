Materials for the course: The Hands-On Guide

These materials are from the course: The Hands-On Guide to Master Apache Airflow on Udemy driven by [Marc Lamberti](https://github.com/marclamberti/).

He owns these materials and I am using them for educational purposes only after I have enrolled in the course.

The sources are from the course and I have added some of my own adjustments on package versions to make it work on MacOS with ARM CPU.

In my case the containerized ecosystem was using Rancher Desktop and not Docker Desktop as the course was using.
